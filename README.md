# Lead-scoring-using-logistic-regression-algorithm
This is a case study on an online education company trying to identify whether a prospective student lead would get converted or not. Me and my friend Gaurav Singh worked together on this exercise so that based on the historical data we could effectively build a logistic regression model. Based on certain parameters for each lead we were able to build a logistic regression model. The model performance was reasonably good as it was able to predict the conversion at an accuracy of 80%, sensitivity/recall of 80%, specificity of 78%
